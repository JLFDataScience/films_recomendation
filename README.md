# Recommendation SystemsðŸ“½ðŸŽ¬
They are used to recommend, for example, to people who have made a particular purchase, what other products might interest you. There are several types of recommendation models.
- **Content**-based Recommendation Model  
This group of algorithms relies on using the description of each product to recommend, without using information from other users to generate the recommendation to the target user.
- **Collaborative** Filters-based Recommendation Model  
Recommendation systems based on user actions. The actions of the users give us information about their own tastes and information of the products themselves. An example might be the Co-occurrence model: To define which products will be recommended you use the co-occurrence matrix that shows which other products purchased the users who purchased that product.
